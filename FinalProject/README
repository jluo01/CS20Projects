Notes on plotDemo.html:
Basic functionality achieved, refinements are noted throughout via
comments in the code

Key next steps: 
Write functions labeled "to be written" that query SQL 
Need to write code that pareses the date strings being passed back and forth 
between functions. No easy way to figure out what # days before 'mm/dd/yyyy' 
is. Potentially switching to date object?
