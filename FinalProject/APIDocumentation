async function callAPI(queryString)
* Purpose: returns a promise for a JSON containing DB response 
* Param: queryString, a fully formed string that contains all of the queries
to be passed into the GET command. Use queryDatabase() to format this string
* Return: JSON object containing response
* Use: call this function with await (e.g., x = await callAPI([queryString])) 
to prevent sync issues

Do not modify the time parameter, just the queryString. The queryString is 
formed in a separate function (see function queryDatabase()).

representing the total amount of fat for all diary entries on 4/17/22 by user 4)
